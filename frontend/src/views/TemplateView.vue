- Create a new directory

Overnight, machines could suddenly do tasks like translating between languages nearly as good as (sometimes better than) humans. Transformers are highly parallelizable and introduce a mechanism, called “attention”, for the model to efficiently place emphasis on specific parts of the input. Transformers analyze the entire input all at once, in parallel, choosing which parts are most important and influential. Every output token is influenced by every input token.

Transformers are highly parallelizable, efficient to train, and produce astounding results. A downside to transformers is that they have a fixed input and output size – the context window – and computation increases quadratically with the size of this window (in some cases, memory does as well!)

Transformers are not the end of the road, but the vast majority of recent improvements in natural language processing have involved them. There is still abundant active research on various ways of implementing and applying them, such as Amazon’s AlexaTM 20B which outperforms GPT-3 in a number of tasks and is an order of magnitude smaller in its number of parameters.`
